{"name":"DCEVM","tagline":"Enhanced class redefinition for Java","body":"# DCEVM\r\n\r\nThis project is a fork of original [DCEVM](http://ssw.jku.at/dcevm/) project. The purpose of the project is to maintain enhanced class redefinition functionality for OpenJDK HotSpot 7/8.\r\n\r\n## Binaries\r\n\r\nLight:\r\n * [Java 7 update 71, build 2](https://github.com/dcevm/dcevm/releases/download/light-jdk7u71%2B2/installer-light-jdk7u71.2.jar)\r\n * [Java 8 update 45, build 3](https://github.com/dcevm/dcevm/releases/download/light-jdk8u45%2B3/DCEVM-light-8u45-installer.jar)\r\n\r\nFull:\r\n * [Java 7 update 51, build 3](https://github.com/dcevm/dcevm/releases/download/full-7u51%2B3/installer-full-jdk7u51.3.jar)\r\n\r\nFull version supports more features (for example, it supports removal of superclasses), but is harder to maintain. Thus, it is only supported for fewer versions of OpenJDK. Light version supports less features (still, it is pretty advanced compared to OpenJDK out-of-the box redefinition functionality), but is easier to keep up with the OpenJDK HotSpot.\r\n\r\n## Sources\r\n\r\nSources of the patches are available [here](https://github.com/dcevm/dcevm).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n* Run `java -jar installer.jar`\r\n* Follow the instructions to install DCEVM into existing JDK/JRE\r\n","google":"UA-50471431-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
